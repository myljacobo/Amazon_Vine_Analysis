# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. I used the dataset for cameras to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.

## Summary

Although there were far less Vine/paid reviews than non-Vine/unpaid reviews, the percentage shows that there seems to be no positivity bias by the Vine reviewers. 5 star reviews came in at 42.3% for Vine reviewers compared to 49.9% for non-Vine reviewers and this proves that the customers who received the free products were not swayed by the zero price. 

An additional analysis that could help support this statement would to also consider the 4 star reviews and the percentages to see if they are similar to the 5 star reviews and can definitely prove there was no bias.
